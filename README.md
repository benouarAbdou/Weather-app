# Flutter Weather App

## Overview

This Flutter Weather App is a comprehensive mobile application that provides real-time weather information and forecasts. Based on the tutorial video by [Romain Girou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMq4wkeHkPc), this project has been expanded with additional features and optimizations.

## Features

- **Current Weather Display**: Shows the current temperature, weather condition, and location.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Provides a summary of weather conditions for the next 5 days.
- **15-Hour Forecast**: Detailed hourly forecast for the next 15 hours.
- **40-Hour Forecast Chart**: Visual representation of temperature trends over the next 40 hours.
- **Dynamic UI**: Changes appearance based on the time of day (morning/evening).
- **Geolocation**: Automatically fetches weather data for the user's current location.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Technologies Used

### Framework
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.

### State Management
- **BLoC (Business Logic Component)**: Used for separating the business logic from the UI.

### APIs
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides weather data and forecasts.

### Packages
- `flutter_bloc`: Implements the BLoC pattern for state management.
- `weather`: Wrapper for the OpenWeatherMap API.
- `geolocator`: Provides easy access to platform-specific location services.
- `intl`: Internationalization and localization support.
- `loading_indicator`: Customizable loading indicators.
- `equatable`: Simplifies equality comparisons for Dart objects.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:

- `lib/`
  - `main.dart`: Entry point of the application.
  - `bloc/`: Contains BLoC-related files for state management.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `data/`: Data-related files, including API keys.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-weather-app.git

     const String API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
     ```

5. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage
